geventirc is a gevent-based irc library, with an emphasis on trying to do common tasks
so that the user doesn't have to.

This was originally based on http://github/gwik/geventirc, however it has diverged signifigantly since then.

The primary means by which a user reacts to messages is using the message handler system:
	@client.handler(command='PRIVMSG', sender='#mychan')
	def chan_message(client, msg):
		...

There are many options to the handler match logic - see message.match()
See also handler.Handler() for advanced handler usage.

Some features that the library will take care of for you:
	* Responding to PINGs
	* Parsing messages in a more intelligent way (more than just a list of params)
	  For example, a MODE will give you a list of (mode, arg, + or -)
	* Tracking ISUPPORT values (and using them, eg, to parse mode strings)
	* Changing your nick safely
	* Tracking what channels you are in
	* Tracking what users are in those channels, and their prefix mode
	* Reacting to forced NICK changes and channel JOINS from the server

A basic example:

from geventirc import Client

nick = 'examplebot'
client = Client('myhost', nick=nick)
channel = client.channel('#mychan')

channel.join()
channel.msg("Hello")

@client.handler(command='PRIVMSG', payload=lambda value: nick in value.lower())
def mentioned(client, msg):
	channel.msg("Hello, {}".format(msg.sender))

client.start()
client.join()
